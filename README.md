# Ray Tracer in C++ with SDL2

This is a ray tracer created from scratch in C++ using the SDL2 library. The program allows you to create and render complex 3D scenes by tracing the path of light as it bounces off objects in the scene. The program uses a variety of ray tracing techniques, including shadows, reflections, and refractions, to produce realistic and visually appealing images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this ray tracer, you will need to have C++ and SDL2 installed on your computer. You can download SDL2 from the official website at https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php.

Once you have downloaded and installed SDL2, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrayoub/raytracing.git
```
After cloning the repository, you can build and run the program using C++ compiler. For example, you can run the following command:

### change derectory to the folder that contains the app
```bash
cd main
```
### make the the app
```bash
make
```

### run the app it loads the scene from file `scene.rt`
```bash
./App
```


## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Ability to create and render 3D scenes
- Support for multiple ray tracing techniques, including shadows, reflections
